About:
This project is for photographers, they are supposed to upload photos and people can comment on them. Each user can add other social links.

How To Use:
To use this app have provided a Postman collection for you to use. I left the @auth off of the ad user. You can add a user and the rest of the app should have to be required to use the routes. At this point of the app the Users, Posts, Links, Comments, and Auth are working. The Photo routes is a work in progress.
